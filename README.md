# ckanext-publications-qld-theme

A custom CKAN extension for Publications.Qld

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/qld-gov-au/ckanext-publications-qld-theme/tree/develop.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/qld-gov-au/ckanext-publications-qld-theme/tree/develop)

## Requirements

This theme was written to work with python 2 and CKAN 2.8.x. Qld Gov has now migrated to 2.9.x py2 and by end of 2022 will be on 2.9.x+ py3.

Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version    | Compatible?     |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2.6 and earlier | no              |
| 2.7             | no              |
| 2.8             | testing dropped |
| 2.9.5+ py2      | yes             |
| 2.9.5+ py3      | yes             |


## Local environment setup

    ```
    Linux (Ubuntu)
    sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install \
      apt-transport-https \

    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```
    If you don't want sudo infront of docker [non-root user manage](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
    ```text

- `pygmy up`
- `ahoy build`

Use `admin`/`password` to login to CKAN.


### If behind a proxy

Add proxy details to docker daemon via https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/
* Create base folder if not existing
  ```sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d```
* add http-proxy file
  ```sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf```
  with details
  ```
  [Service]
  Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:3128/"
  ```
* add https-proxy file
  ```bash
  sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/https-proxy.conf
  ```
  with details
  ```bash
  [Service]
  Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:3128/"
  ```

* Reload systemd
```
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart docker
  ```
* ensure /etc/gemrc has your proxy
  ```
  http_proxy: http://localhost:3128
  https_proxy: http://localhost:3128
  ```
* Configure internal proxy settings in the docker machines form [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/)

  ~/.docker/config.json
    ```
    {
      "proxies":
    {
      "default":
    {
      "httpProxy": "http://hostexternalip:3128",
      "httpsProxy": "http://hostexternalip:3128"
    }
    }
    }
    ```


That should be it. If you still have problems you can also update ruby proxy and internal docker environment settings

* if you have squid proxy please ensure you allow docker containers to access it ensure these records exist
```text
http_access allow local-net

acl local-net src ${your external ip address}/32 # replace ${your external ip address} with your external ip
acl local-net src 10.0.0.0/8 # RFC1918 possible internal network

```

* update /etc/hosts

## Coding standards
Python code linting uses [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) with configuration captured in `.flake8` file.

Set `ALLOW_LINT_FAIL=1` in `.env` to allow lint failures.

## Nose tests
`ahoy test-unit`

Set `ALLOW_UNIT_FAIL=1` in `.env` to allow unit test failures.

## Behavioral tests
`ahoy test-bdd`

Set `ALLOW_BDD_FAIL=1` in `.env` to allow BDD test failures.

### How it works
We are using [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave) BDD _framework_ with additional _step definitions_ provided by [Behaving](https://github.com/ggozad/behaving) library.

Custom steps described in `test/features/steps/steps.py`.

Test scenarios located in `test/features/*.feature` files.

Test environment configuration is located in `test/features/environment.py` and is setup to connect to a remote Chrome
instance running in a separate Docker container.

During the test, Behaving passes connection information to [Splinter](https://github.com/cobrateam/splinter) which
instantiates WebDriver object and establishes connection with Chrome instance. All further communications with Chrome
are handled through this driver, but in a developer-friendly way.

For a list of supported step-definitions, see https://github.com/ggozad/behaving#behavingweb-supported-matcherssteps.

## Automated builds (Continuous Integration)
In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
Before feature changes can be merged into a shared mainline, a complete build must run and pass all tests on CI server.

This project uses [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) as a CI server: it imports production backups into fully built codebase and runs code linting and tests. When tests pass, a deployment process is triggered for nominated branches (usually, `master` and `develop`).

Add `[skip ci]` to the commit subject to skip CI build. Useful for documentation changes.

### SSH
Circle CI supports shell access to the build for 120 minutes after the build is finished when the build is started with SSH support. Use "Rerun job with SSH" button in Circle CI UI to start build with SSH support.
